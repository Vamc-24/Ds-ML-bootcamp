    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        I am a third-year B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. Passionate about uncovering insights from data, I aspire to build intelligent and data-driven solutions that solve real-world problems.<br>

<br>Over the past few semesters, I have actively explored areas such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), SQL, Excel, and Power BI, and have built several projects to gain hands-on experience. These experiences have helped me understand how to analyze, clean, and visualize data effectively to support data-driven decision-making.<br>

<br>I am proficient in Python, SQL, Microsoft Excel, and key Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Iâ€™m currently on a learning path to explore Machine Learning (ML), Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Iâ€™m focused on building practical skills by working with real-world datasets and tools.<br>
<br>
<b>ðŸ”§ Technical Skills:</b> Python, SQL, Excel, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Power BI<br>
<b>ðŸ’¡ Learning Goals:</b> Machine Learning, NLP, DSA, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow<br>
<b>ðŸŽ¯ Career Goal:</b> To become a Data Scientist who applies AI and analytics to solve impactful problems across industries.<br>
<br>Iâ€™m open to internships, collaborative projects, and learning opportunities where I can grow as a data science professional. Letâ€™s connect and grow together in this exciting field!<br>
